      <h4>Objectives</h4>
      <p>As a chess enthusiast, I am always interested in finding high-score openings.</p>
      <p>In this analysis, I will look at win rates of different openings at all levels and intermediate levels in rapid time format, finding the highest win rate openings among white and black colours, and see their popularity in association.</p>
      <p>At the end, I will recommend some openings based on the analysis results.</p>

      <h4>Kaggle Notebook</h4>
      <p>My notebook for this analysis on Kaggle can be founded here: <a target="__blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/austinnguyen00/chess-openings-analysis">Chess_Openings_Analysis</a></p>

      <h4>Data Source</h4>
      <p>I use chess data from available dataset sources on Kaggle. You can look and download the dataset at: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/chess">Chess Game Dataset (Lichess)</a> </p>

    <h1>2. Data Pre-Processing </h1>
    <div class="data-wrapper">
      <p>The data is already cleaned with no significant data missing, so there is not much to do for data cleansing</p>
      <p>I use 5 out of 16 attributes in the original data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>1. winner</b> - categorical data with 3 values: white, black, draw</li>
          <li><b>2. increment code</b> - categorical data of game time control</li>
          <li><b>3. white rating</b> - rating of white player</li>
          <li><b>4. black rating</b> - rating of black player</li>
          <li><b>5. opening name</b></li>
        </ul>
      <p>I also add in 2 fields into the dataset for analysis purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>6. first move</b> - string format of first move of the game</li>
          <li><b>7. appearances</b>- how many games the openings are included in the dataset</li>

    <h1>5. Openings Recommendation</h1>
    <p>I will categorize this based on the last move in the opening is played by white or black</p>
    <p>If the last move in the opening tree is white, then I will put it in the white recommendation section, and the same for black</p>

    <div class="recommendation-wrapper">
      <h2>Recommendation for White</h2>
      <p>1. Scotch Game (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4) is a fairly decent opening for white at all levels that score well </p>
      <p>2. As a white player, you should not play Van't Kruijs opening, which is starting the game with the move 1.e3, as this score is significantly poor for white.</p>
      <p>3. At the Intermediate level, if you play against the French Defense (1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5), the Exchange variation is a good variation that you can play as white with 3.exd5</p>
      <p>4. If facing the Sicilian Defense, two variations that white should avoid are the Bowdler Attack(1.e4 c5 2.Bc4) and Alapin Variation(1.e4 c5 2.c3). Both do not score well for white</p>
    </div>

    <div class="recommendation-wrapper">
      <h2>Recommendation for Black</h2>
      <p>1. Sicilian Defense is the best weapon black against 1.e4 at all levels </p>
      <p>2. Most of the Sicilian setups are feasible choices, but the French Variation(1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 2.e6) in this opening score quite high at both low and high level</p>
      <p>3. Against 1.d4, black can play the Indian game(1.Nf6) which is quite popular at the intermediate level with a decent win rate for black as well </p>
