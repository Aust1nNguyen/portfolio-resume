  <h2>Background Stories</h2>
  <p>
    Hi everyone,
  </p>
  <p>
    In November of 2022, I first came across OpenAI and their GPT-3 models. I was amazed and stunned by its powerful language performance, which can be applied to natural language or coding language. I thought it could be an exciting idea for me to build a simple application powered by GPT-3 as a portfolio project for my resume, so the journey with WordfixerBot begins.
  </p>
  <p>I build WordfixerBot as a simple AI language processing tool that can paraphrase, grammar check, and summarize texts.</p>
  <p>Two weeks after getting started, I started showcasing the first version of this tool, mostly on Reddit, and after receiving much positive feedback, I found that it has the potential to generate revenue. So I decided to turn it into a MicroSaas product that I can build to get more experience on my journey to become an Indie Hacker.</p>
  <p>I have faced many challenges around marketing my tool to get the first batch of initial customers. As someone who does not have a lot of marketing experience, I know that I must get my hand wets and just do it. I start with posts on Reddit on many tech subreddits and submit my product to product listing pages, and it helps me to get some feedback from early customers that I can use to improve my tool.</p>
  <p>I am still on my journey to get better at marketing, and hopefully, I can reach my first goal revenue of $2,000 MRR in the next few months. I believe that if I work harder and smarter and believe in myself, I can achieve my goals and get more customers.</p>
  <p>I am happy to answer any questions and would love to receive any feedback about the tool! </p>
  <p>You can contact me by sending me an email at the footer of the page.</p>
